We are Team Neural Nebula — united to protect forests.

Meet the Forest Investigation App — empowering students to explore, investigate, and protect forests using NASA SAR data.”

With the app, take a virtual tour of forests. Monitor live forest health and threats,Use dedicated AI tools to turn complex SAR data into insights, brainstorm ideas, create reports, and climb the leaderboard. Top performers can collaborate with NGOs and governments to make a real-world impact.”

Forest Investigation empowers the next generation — the future guardians of Earth — to save forests, preserve biodiversity, and build a sustainable planet for all.”

Note : This project uses AI tools thoughtfully to assist development and creativity:
AI Agent Trae – Automates repetitive coding tasks to streamline development.
Lovable & Bolt.new – Helps visualize unique concepts generated by our team’s ideas.
All AI usage is purposeful and controlled; AI is used as a supportive tool rather than generating content randomly or replacing human creativity.
