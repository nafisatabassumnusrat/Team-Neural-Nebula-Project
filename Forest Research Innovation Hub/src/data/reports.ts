      'changes-over-time': 'The Amazon has lost over 800,000 kmÂ² of forest since the 1970s, with deforestation rates fluctuating based on economic and political factors.',
      'high-carbon-areas': 'The Amazon stores approximately 150-200 billion tonnes of carbon, representing 10% of global terrestrial carbon storage.',
      'forest-density': 'Amazon forest density varies from sparse cerrado to dense terra firme forests, with canopy coverage ranging from 60-95%.',
      'climate-monitoring': 'Climate change is shifting precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures, potentially turning parts of the Amazon from carbon sink to carbon source.',
      'biodiversity-health': 'The Amazon hosts 10% of known species globally, but faces severe biodiversity loss due to habitat destruction and fragmentation.'

      'changes-over-time': 'The Taiga experiences dynamic changes due to natural fire cycles, insect outbreaks, and climate-driven tree line shifts.',
      'high-carbon-areas': 'Boreal forests store carbon primarily in soils and peatlands, with total storage of approximately 272 billion tonnes.',
      'forest-density': 'Taiga density is relatively low compared to tropical forests, with open canopies and sparse understory vegetation.',
      'climate-monitoring': 'Climate change is causing rapid warming in boreal regions, leading to increased fire frequency and pest outbreaks.',
      'biodiversity-health': 'While less biodiverse than tropical forests, the Taiga supports key species like caribou, lynx, and numerous migratory birds.'
